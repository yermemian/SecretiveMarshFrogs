# SecretiveMarshFrogs
In this project, I collaborated with classmates Akhil Ghosh and Stephen Vosburgh; and with ecologists in the Loyola Chicago School of Environmental Sustainability. We sought to come up with an automatic detection method for finding calls from hours of audio recordings of secretive marsh birds in northern Michigan. We made extensive use of the packages Ohun and warbleR in R, with advising from package developer Marcelo Araya-Salas. We also received advising from professor Gregory Matthews.
